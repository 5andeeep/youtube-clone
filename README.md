# youtube-clone

It is my first attempt to clone Youtube. I learnt, how to use JSON and how to fetch the data with the help of API.
After fetching data I used DOM to display the data in HTML elements.
I created to pages only, one is the main page of youtube and the other one when we click on any video then we redirect to the video player page.
